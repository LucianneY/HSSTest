The goal of this exercise is to show competence with Bash, R, and git.

To test this, we give the following exercise.
1. Write an R script that takes in a single CSV file, plots the data, and saves the plot to disk.
2. Write a bash script that takes a directory and runs the above R script on each CSV file in that directory.
3. Upload both scripts to a public git repo (github/gitlab) with supporting documentation.

An ideal result will allow us to pull the git repo and run the scripts as specified in the README without errors to generate moderately attractive plots.

# Notes about the input CSV files
The data are generated by the same program and as such have the same column names, order, and data types.
However, the program will produce a variable number of columns (either 3 or 4) which depend on the type of experiment.
For each dataset plot all of the data. No specific type of plot is expected, simply plot it however you choose.
The data types should remain as is and are distinct (i.e. integers are integers and should not be converted to factors. Lower case and upper case letters are distinct factor levels).

Additional notes from our own experience performing this test.
From Dave -- The test is intended to be a minimum viable product (MVP), not a fully fledged program with pristine outputs, complex logic, and sophisticated argument parsing.
From Yurii -- Take some time to look at the data. There are dozens of ways to plot these data, I suggest selecting one or two that represent the data best and focusing on those. Also, don't overthink it, these are synthetic data and are not intended to be interpreted.
